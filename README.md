### Deploying a highly available multi-regional Cloud Run service with Global HTTPS load balancing on Google Cloud

This repository contains sample Terraform code to deploy a very basic "hello" application to Google Cloud run as a container, the container image is pre-built and available in Google's public artifact registry, we will just configure our Cloud Run service to use that. The service will be deployed in two Google Cloud regions, us-central1 and us-east1. A Gloabl HTTPS load balancer will "front" the services as a layer-7 proxy.

The services are configured as "serverless" network endpoint groups behind the load balancer and will be accessible publicly only via the load balancer, even though Google Cloud does yield a "run.app" domain for each Cloud Run service, our "ingress" controls will prevent any direct invocations of the Cloud Run generated domain URL. This will ensure that:
1. We leverage Google Front End or GFE for global load distribution and locality, let GFE route the incoming request to the nearest backend.
2. This will also improve serving latencies, thus serving the webpage from a Google data center closest to the end user.
3. At the load balancer, we will also configure TLS certifactes and thus load balancer will also act as a point of TLS termination for the end user.
4. Since we will be adding a few security policies (through Google Cloud Armor), routing all the incoming internet traffic through the global load balancer will ensure that thos security policies are applied and any malcious traffic is denied at the edge of the Google network.

Before you begin, please make sure you do the following:
1. You should have an account, the account should have "owner" role at the project level, it's highly recommended that in your production environments you use the principle of least privileges and thus do not assign overly permissive roles to users/groups, however for the sake of simplicity here, we will use "project owner" role.
2. At any point in time, choose security over convinience when dealing with your prod and non-prod environments, the demo does not guide on IAM best practices and thus uses privilged roles like "project owner", this by no means is Google's recommendation, it's okay do use permissive roles in demo/lab environments which will be re-cycled soon after.
3. Once you have the account as stated in step-1, next step is to create a project, you can do that by directly logging into Google Cloud console, if you have "project owner" permissions, you shall be able to create new projects.
4. After you have created the project, make sure it's selected in the "project" drop-down.
5. Click on the "Activate Cloud Shell" icon towards the right corner of you screen and wait for your Cloud Shell instance to load.

##### Please note, that this tutorial uses Cloud Shell for the sake of simplicity, since Cloud Shell comes installed with automation tools like Hashicorp Terraform, Git CLI etc, there is no need to install any of the tools that are used in this demo. If you don't have access to Cloud Shell or Cloud Console, you can install gcloud SDK, terraform and Git CLI on your workstation and perform the steps listed here with few exceptions.

Once the Cloud Shell instance is ready, first make sure you have the right configurations on the gcloud SDK before you issue any commands.

```
gcloud auth list
```
Above command, should show the current account you are authenticated with, make sure it's the same account you logged in with and is having "owner" role.

Next, check the gcloud's current configuration

```
gcloud config list
```
Output of this command should show you the current project and other details, project is of prime importance here, we want to make sure that our resources are created in the right project, if you do not see the right project, you can do the following:

```
gcloud config set project <enter the correct project name>
```
Google's terraform provider uses application default credentials or ADC for authentication and access controls, to know more about how ADC works you can refer to the link in the appendix but in a nut shell, ADC is an iterative determination of credentials which SDKs or client libraries must use while authenticating against Google Cloud APIs and services. The following gcloud command will update the ADC locally in a file at a known location, ADC will contain credentials, project and billing context for the client libraries to use. Note, that the following command requires that your machine must have an accessible browser, unfortunately Cloud Shell does not, so while you can run this on your workstation with a browser, for Cloud Shell, you may use the second version of this command:

```
gcloud auth application-default login
```
Or, since we are running this from Cloud Shell:

```
gcloud auth login --activate --no-launch-browser --quiet --update-adc
```
Follow the instructions and the OAuth 2.0 flow, by the end of all the steps, your ADCs will be updated, the project remains set as you observed when running gcloud config list command, if you wish to change, the gcloud config set project command shall help, however make sure if you change the project, the user you authenticated must have sufficient permissions on the project.

Another alternative is to simply create a separate service account with required permissions and generate a key file, then download the key file locally on your Cloud Shell instance or workstation and set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment varible pointing to the absolute path of the key file, Terraform provider should be able to refer to it, you can also configure the location of the file explicitly on the provider. Using key files locally is not always the best practice though and many orgs may just discourage it even disable it through "organization policies", use ADCs as much as possible or consider workload identity federation (not covered here but link in the appendix).
